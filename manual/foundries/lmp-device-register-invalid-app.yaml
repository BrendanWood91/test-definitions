    steps:
        - boot up the device
        - ensure device is not registered to a factory 
          check /var/sota/sql.db  is not present on device
        - register app which is not defined in containers.git
          run "lmp-device-register -apps<invalid-appname> -n<name>"
        - authenticate device with user code in browser   
        - Verify  no apps are enabled on device
          run "fioctl devices list -f <factory>"
          run "docker ps" on device 
                       
    expected:
       - device should register normally       
       - specifying a specifc app which does not exist during registration overrides default to enable all apps
       - no apps should be available on device
