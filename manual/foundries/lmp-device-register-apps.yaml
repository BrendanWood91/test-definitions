    steps:
        - boot up the device
        - ensure device is not registered to a factory 
          check /var/sota/sql.db  is not present on device
        - register 1 or more but not all available apps to device
          run "lmp-device-register -apps<appname,appname> -n<name>"
        - authenticate device with user code in browser   
        - Verify only specified apps are enabled
          run "fioctl devices list -f <factory>"
          run "docker ps" on device
